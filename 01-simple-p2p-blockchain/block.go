 * Mining is essentially adding new blocks to our block chain with a certain

 * The difficulty level is dynamically adjusted to ensure that the average time
 * between the creation of new blocks remains relatively constant. This is crucial for
 * maintaining the consistency and security of the blockchain.
 * The difficulty is usually set in such a way that miners,
 * who are participants in the network responsible for validating
 * and adding new blocks, need to solve a complex mathematical problem to
 * create a new block. The difficulty adjusts regularly based on factors such as
 * the total computational power of the network. If more miners join the
 * network and the overall computational power increases, the difficulty level
 * is raised to maintain a consistent block creation time.
