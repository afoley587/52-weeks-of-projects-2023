# DSA In GoLang - Sorting

I'm going to go on a limb and say that you're like me - it's been a while
since you've took a good hard look at data structures and algorithms (DSA).
I haven't formally been testing on these things since I was in school and,
even though I do use these principles in my own work quite often, it's nice
to sometimes have a refresher course. Especially if you're learning a new 
language. When I first started learning Go, I spent a few hours googling 
"Good GoLang Projects For Beginners" and a whole bunch of stuff came up.
But, sometimes it's hard to find a good project. What are the inputs? What
are the outputs? Where are the bugs? Etc... That's why I just re-picked up
some of the standard DSA type things. You know what the inputs are, you know
what the outputs should be, and all of these algorithms are so extensively
researched and documented that finding the bug and seeing any underlying
issues becomes blatanly obvious. So, let's do two things today:

1. A brief refresher of some of the more well-known sorting algorithms 
    (Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, Heap Sort, and Quick Sort)
2. Implementing these in GoLang and then running test cases on them

## A Naive Approach - Bubble Sort
Let's first talk about the first 

## An Improved Approach - Insertion Sort
## A Datastructure Approach - Heap Sort
## A Recursive Approach - Quick Sort
